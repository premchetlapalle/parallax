            <h2 style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 4rem;">Facts About The Solar System!</h2>
            <p class="text">       
                The solar system comprises the Sun and its celestial companions, including eight planets, moons,
                 asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the rocky inner planets,
                  while Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the gas giants. Moons orbit many planets, with 
                  Jupiter's Ganymede being the largest. 
                  <br> <br>
                  Asteroids and comets are remnants of the solar system's
                   formation, with some, like Ceres and Halley's Comet, notable. Pluto, once considered a planet, 
                   is now classified as a dwarf planet. The solar system's vastness offers endless opportunities 
                   for exploration and understanding the universe's workings.

                <h2 class="desc desc1">MERCURY</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">      
                Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is characterized by its rugged, cratered 
                surface and extreme temperature shifts. It lacks a significant atmosphere, leading to scorching
                 daytime temperatures and frigid nights. With a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers, it is smaller than Earth's moon.
                <br>  <br>
                Its composition primarily consists of silicate rock and a large metallic core. Mercury's orbit around the Sun takes
                 approximately 88 Earth days, making it a unique celestial body for scientific exploration.

                <h2 class="desc desc2">VENUS</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">      
                Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. 
                It is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a dense and opaque atmosphere that traps heat, resulting in surface
                temperatures hot enough to melt lead.  
                <br>  <br>
                Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, a phenomenon called retrograde rotation. Its surface is marked by volcanoes,
                 mountains, and vast plains, making it an intriguing target for planetary research.

            <p class="text">    
                
                Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known celestial body to support life.
                 It has a diverse and dynamic surface, featuring vast oceans, continents, 
                and a variety of ecosystems. 
                <br>  <br>
                Earth's atmosphere contains oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases vital for life. With a 
                diameter of about 12,742 kilometers, it has a molten iron core 
                that generates a magnetic field, protecting the planet from harmful solar radiation.
                <br> <br>
                Earth's surface, 71% ocean, regulates climate, supports diverse marine life. Continents
                 host varied landscapes: mountains, forests, deserts,
                 plains, each with unique ecosystems.

                Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the "Red Planet" due to its rusty surface.
                It has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide.
                 Mars features the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon,
                  Valles Marineris. 
                <br>  <br>
                Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water, implying the potential for past habitability.
                 Exploration missions have revealed polar ice caps, suggesting 
                the presence of water ice. Recent missions, including rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance,
                 aim to study Martian geology, climate, and potential for life, paving the way for future 
                 human exploration and colonization efforts.

                Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant with a thick atmosphere 
                primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its iconic feature, the Great Red Spot, is a 
                massive storm larger than Earth. Jupiter has a strong 
                magnetic field and numerous moons, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons: 
                Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
                <br>  <br>
                It possesses a complex ring system and a dynamic atmosphere with colorful bands and 
                swirling storms. Jupiter's immense size and influence make it
                 a fascinating subject for scientific study and exploration.

                Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a gas giant renowned for its spectacular 
                ring system, composed mostly of ice particles and dust. It boasts the second-largest 
                planetary rings in the solar system. Saturn's atmosphere,
                 predominantly hydrogen and helium, hosts unique features like hexagonal cloud patterns
                  at its north pole.
                <br>  <br>
                It has numerous moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, 
                with a thick 
                atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes. Saturn's beauty and complexity continue to captivate 
                astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.

                Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant characterized by its unique tilt,
                 causing it to rotate on its side. It has a pale blue color 
                due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Uranus has a system of faint rings and
                 a diverse array of moons, including Miranda, which displays dramatic surface features.
                <br>  <br>
                Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane and 
                other gases. Uranus remains a mysterious and intriguing world for planetary scientists 
                to study.
